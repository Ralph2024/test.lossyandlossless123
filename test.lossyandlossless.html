     <h1>Lossless vs Lossy Compression: Understanding Data Compression Methods
     <h2> Welcome Prospective TM111 Students!</h2>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3>Lossless Compression vs Lossy</h3>
     <p>Comression is the process of reducing the size of data files by encoding them in a more 
     efficient way. There are two types of compression:lossless and lossy.Lossless compression
     is a method that compresses data in such a way that no data is lost during the compression
     process.This means that the original data can beperfectly reconstructed from the compressed
     data.Lossless compression is commonly used for data that cannot afford any loss,such as text 
     files,spreadsheets,and program code.It is also useful for images that need to be edited or
     resized without any loss of quality.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3>Lossy Compression</H3>
     <P>Lossy compression is a method that compresses data by removing some of the data permanently.
     This means that the original data cannot be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.
     Lossy compression is commonly used for data that can afford some loss,such as images,videos,and 
     audio files.It is also useful for reducing the size of large files for efficient storage and transfer.</P>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3>When to use Lossless or Lossy Compression for Images</h3>
     <P>If the image contains important details that need to be preserved without any loss,such as
     in medical imaging or graphic design,then lossless compression should be used.However,if the image
     contains non-critical details that can be sacrificed for a smaller file size, such as in web or
     mobile applications,then lossy compression should be used.</p>
